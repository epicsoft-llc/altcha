# API reference

Part of the [ALTCHA service](../README.md). Both ports speak JSON.

## Public port

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /widget.js` | the ALTCHA widget (ES module, English) |
| `GET /widget.i18n.js` | the widget with all translations |
| `GET /challenge` | a new challenge for the site of the `Origin` |
| `POST /verify` | check a solution, from a browser or a backend |
| `POST /submit` | check a solution and mail the form to the site's recipient |

Bodies are accepted as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` (flat, no nested objects), up to `MAX_BODY_BYTES`. `multipart/form-data` — and with it file uploads — is refused.

### Refusals

Reasons a request is refused, as `error` in the answer and as `reason` in the metrics:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `route_unknown` | no such endpoint |
| `origin_unknown` | the page is not listed for any site |
| `site_disabled` | the page belongs to a site that is switched off |
| `site_unknown` | `/verify` named a site that does not exist or is disabled, or the solution belongs to a site that was deleted or disabled since |
| `submit_disabled` | the site has no recipient, or SMTP is not configured |
| `altcha_missing`, `altcha_malformed` | no solution, or not one this service can read |
| `altcha_algorithm` | the challenge uses another algorithm than `ALTCHA_ALGORITHM` |
| `altcha_signature` | the challenge was not issued by this service, or was altered |
| `altcha_expired` | the challenge is older than `ALTCHA_EXPIRES` |
| `altcha_solution` | the solution does not solve the challenge |
| `altcha_site` | the solution was issued for another site |
| `altcha_replay` | the solution was spent before |
| `rate_challenge`, `rate_ip`, `rate_site` | a rate limit was hit |
| `body_too_large`, `body_malformed`, `body_incomplete`, `too_many_fields`, `unsupported_media_type` | the request body |
| `delivery_failed` | the mail server did not accept the mail |
| `honeypot` | metrics only — the client is told it succeeded |

## Admin port

Every request needs a sign-in when one is configured - see *Signing in* in the README.

| Route | |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | the web UI |
| `GET /api/status` | version, settings (without secrets), widget languages |
| `GET /api/stats?range=<range>&site=<id>` | history: totals per period, the same totals for the period before, refused requests by reason. `range` is `24h`, `7d`, `30d` or `90d`; without `site` for all sites, `site=0` for requests that matched no site |
| `GET /api/sites`, `POST /api/sites` | list (with the activity of the last 24 hours), create |
| `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE /api/sites/<id>` | read, replace, delete |
| `POST /api/sites/<id>/test-mail` | send a test mail to the site's recipient |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus metrics |
| `GET /healthz` | `200 ok` when the database answers — **without authentication**, for the container health check |

Every changing request needs the header `X-Altcha-Admin: 1` - except one signed in with the API token. A browser sends Basic credentials and proxy session cookies along with any request to the port, also one triggered by a foreign page; a custom header cannot be set by such a page without a CORS preflight, which the admin port never grants. A bearer token, on the other hand, is never sent by a browser on its own.

A site as the API takes it:

```json
{
  "name": "example",
  "origins": ["https://example.com", "https://www.example.com"],
  "recipient": "office@example.com",
  "subjectPrefix": "[example.com]",
  "submitPerHour": 200,
  "successUrl": "https://example.com/thanks",
  "errorUrl": "https://example.com/contact",
  "enabled": true,
  "note": ""
}
```

The name is part of every challenge: renaming a site invalidates the challenges already handed out for it, which costs a visitor at most one more click on the widget. There is no limit on the number of origins - a landing page served under a hundred parked domains is one site with two hundred origins; the editor adds the `www.` variants with one click.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://admin.altcha.example.com/api/sites
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"example","origins":["https://example.com"],"recipient":"office@example.com"}' \
  https://admin.altcha.example.com/api/sites
```
