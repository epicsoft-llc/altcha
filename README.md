# ALTCHA service

This Docker image is managed and kept up to date by [epicsoft LLC](https://epicsoft.one).

A self-hosted service that protects web forms with [ALTCHA](https://altcha.org) proof-of-work challenges — for many sites at once, managed in a small web UI. It issues and verifies the challenges, serves the widget, and can mail a verified form submission, so a static site gets a working contact form without a backend of its own.

## Features

- Challenges in the current ALTCHA format (widget v3), signed with HMAC and bound to the site they were issued for
- Every solution can be spent exactly once, also across restarts
- Sites managed in a web UI: any number of allowed origins, mail recipient, subject prefix, rate limit, redirect pages
- Statistics in the web UI: activity over 24 hours to 90 days, totals compared with the period before, refused requests by reason — for all sites or one
- `/submit` mails a verified form to the site's recipient — no backend needed for a static site
- `/verify` for applications with their own backend
- The widget is served by the service itself, in English or with all of its 68 languages, so no project copies a JavaScript file into its repository
- Rate limits per client address and per site, a honeypot field, strict origin check
- No cookies, no state in the browser, no file uploads
- Prometheus metrics (requests, latencies, solve times, mail, database, process), a container health check, data in a single SQLite file

## Screenshots

## How it works

```
browser                      this service                         your backend (optional)
   |  GET  /widget.js  ---------->|
   |  GET  /challenge  ---------->|  signed challenge for the site of the Origin
   |  (widget solves it)          |
   |  POST /submit  ------------->|  verify, mark as spent, mail to the site's recipient
   |                              |
   |  POST /your-form  -------------------------------------------------->|
   |                              |<------------  POST /verify  ----------|
   |                              |  verify, mark as spent  ------------->|
```

A request from a browser is mapped to a site by its `Origin` header (or `Referer`). A page that is not listed for any site gets no challenge and cannot submit.

## Quick start

```yaml
services:
  altcha:
    image: epicsoft/altcha:0.0.1
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      PUBLIC_URL: https://altcha.example.com
      TRUST_PROXY: 1            # one reverse proxy in front, see "Behind a reverse proxy"
      HMAC_SECRET_FILE: /run/secrets/altcha_hmac
      ADMIN_USERNAME: admin
      ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/altcha_admin
      SMTP_HOST: mail.example.com
      SMTP_USERNAME: forms@example.com
      SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/altcha_smtp
      SMTP_FROM: forms@example.com
    secrets:
      - altcha_hmac
      - altcha_admin
      - altcha_smtp
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"   # public port - reached through the TLS proxy on this host
      - "127.0.0.1:8081:8081"   # admin UI - never on a public address
    read_only: true
    cap_drop: [ALL]
    security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]

secrets:
  altcha_hmac:
    file: ./secrets/hmac        # at least 32 random characters, e.g. openssl rand -hex 32
  altcha_admin:
    file: ./secrets/admin
  altcha_smtp:
    file: ./secrets/smtp
```

The service runs as user `node` (uid `1000`), so the data directory has to be writable for it:

```bash
mkdir -p data && sudo chown 1000:1000 data
```

Open the admin UI on port `8081`, create a site with its origins (for example `https://www.example.com`) and, if the service should mail its form, a recipient. The **Embed** button shows the snippet for that site.

## Embedding

### A form mailed by the service

```html
<script type="module" src="https://altcha.example.com/widget.js"></script>

<form action="https://altcha.example.com/submit" method="post">
  <input name="name" required>
  <input name="email" type="email" required>
  <input name="subject">
  <textarea name="message" required></textarea>
  <input name="website" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off" aria-hidden="true" class="hp">
  <altcha-widget challenge="https://altcha.example.com/challenge"></altcha-widget>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

<style>
  .hp { position: absolute; left: -10000px; }
</style>
```

- No build step and no npm package — the same two lines work in a hand-written HTML file, in Astro and in Angular.
- A plain form post (as above) is redirected to the site's **page after sending** or **page after an error**; the error page receives the reason as `?error=<reason>`. Without these pages, and for every request sent with `fetch`, the answer is JSON: `{"ok":true}` or `{"ok":false,"error":"<reason>"}`.
- Every field of the form ends up in the mail. `email`, when it holds a plain address, becomes the `Reply-To`; `subject` follows the site's subject prefix, separated by a space.
- `website` is the honeypot (`HONEYPOT_FIELD`): a human never fills it in. A submission that does is answered like a success and dropped. Under a Content Security Policy without `'unsafe-inline'` for styles the `<style>` block is ignored and the field shows — move the rule into your stylesheet then.
- For a widget in another language use `/widget.i18n.js` (all translations, about 180 kB instead of 120 kB) and set `language="de"` on `<altcha-widget>`.

### Pages with a Content Security Policy

The widget is loaded from this service, fetches its challenge from it, solves it in Web Workers it creates from a `blob:` URL (falling back to `data:`), and adds one `<style>` element to the page. A page with a CSP has to allow that:

```
script-src  'self' https://altcha.example.com
connect-src 'self' https://altcha.example.com
worker-src  'self' blob:
form-action 'self' https://altcha.example.com
```

`form-action` only matters for a form that posts to `/submit` directly. For the `<style>` element, either allow `'unsafe-inline'` in `style-src`, or put the nonce of your CSP into `<meta name="csp-nonce" content="…">` — the widget sets it on the element.

### A form handled by your own backend

The widget writes its solution into the form field `altcha`. Your backend passes it on:

```bash
curl -X POST https://altcha.example.com/verify \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"altcha": "<value of the altcha field>", "site": "example"}'
```

```json
{"ok": true, "verified": true, "site": "example"}
```

A refused solution is answered with `403` and `{"ok": false, "error": "<reason>"}`. Send `site` — without it the service accepts a solution for any of its sites and only tells you which one it was in the answer. The solution is spent by this call: a second `/verify` with the same value is refused as `altcha_replay`.

## Public endpoints

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /widget.js` | the ALTCHA widget (ES module, English) |
| `GET /widget.i18n.js` | the widget with all translations |
| `GET /challenge` | a new challenge for the site of the `Origin` |
| `POST /verify` | check a solution, from a browser or a backend |
| `POST /submit` | check a solution and mail the form to the site's recipient |

Bodies are accepted as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` (flat, no nested objects), up to `MAX_BODY_BYTES`. `multipart/form-data` — and with it file uploads — is refused.

The reasons a request can be refused - the `error` of the answer and the `reason` of the metrics - are listed in the [API reference](https://gitlab.com/epicsoft-networks/altcha/-/blob/main/docs/api.md).

## Admin port

The admin port (`ADMIN_PORT`, default `8081`) serves the web UI, the site API, `/metrics` and `/healthz`. **Do not publish it on a public address.** Bind it to `127.0.0.1`, a VPN or an internal network; the sign-in is the second layer - the UI warns while there is none.

### Signing in

Three ways, in any combination:

| Way | Set | For |
|---|---|---|
| **Through a reverse proxy** | `ADMIN_PROXY_USER_HEADER` (e.g. `X-Forwarded-User`, `Remote-User`) and `ADMIN_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | people - single sign-on via oauth2-proxy, Authelia, Traefik ForwardAuth or any proxy that signs users in and passes the name on |
| **Basic auth** | `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | people, without a proxy |
| **API token** | `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (at least 32 characters) | scripts: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |

- **The proxy header is only believed from `ADMIN_TRUSTED_PROXIES`** - IP addresses or CIDR ranges of the proxies, as the service sees them (behind Docker usually the proxy container or the network gateway). From any other address the header is ignored, otherwise everybody could send it. `ADMIN_ALLOWED_USERS` narrows it down to the listed user names; without it, everybody the proxy lets through is in.
- **After 10 failed passwords or tokens from one address the address is locked out for 15 minutes** - also for correct credentials, so a lucky guess cannot be told apart. IPv6 counts per /64. Behind a trusted proxy the address is the last `X-Forwarded-For` entry. `altcha_admin_auth_refused_total` counts the refusals.
- **Requests with the API token need no `X-Altcha-Admin` header** - a browser never sends a bearer token on its own, so there is nothing to forge. Everything else that changes something does.
- Basic auth and a token travel with every request: reach the port through TLS or a tunnel when it is not on the same machine.

The API - routes, the shape of a site, examples with the token - is described in the [API reference](https://gitlab.com/epicsoft-networks/altcha/-/blob/main/docs/api.md).

### The web UI

- **Statistics** for 24 hours, 7, 30 or 90 days, for all sites or a single one: totals with the change against the period before, activity as a chart (with a table view and keyboard navigation), refused requests by reason. The period still running is drawn faint, so it does not read as a drop.
- **Sites**: search across name, note, address and origins, filter by state, sort by name or activity, switch a site on and off in its row, edit, delete, send a test mail, copy the embed code with the widget language of your choice.
- Refreshes itself every 30 seconds while the tab is visible. Light and dark follow the system and can be switched. Works down to phone width.

## Behind a reverse proxy

Put a TLS terminating proxy in front of the public port. Set `TRUST_PROXY` to the number of proxies in front of the service, so the rate limits count the address of the visitor and not the one of the proxy: with `TRUST_PROXY=1` the last entry of `X-Forwarded-For` is taken. Leave it at `0` when the port is reached directly — otherwise every client can pick its own address by sending the header.

## Data and backups

Everything that has to survive a restart is in `DATA_DIR` (`/data`), in a single SQLite database `altcha.db` (WAL mode, so `altcha.db-wal` and `altcha.db-shm` sit next to it): the sites, the spent challenges and the statistics - hourly totals per site, kept for `STATS_RETENTION_DAYS`. The files are created readable for the service user only (`0600`), and the root file system of the container can stay read-only. The Prometheus counters live in memory and start at zero after a restart, as Prometheus expects.

A consistent copy while the service runs:

```bash
sqlite3 data/altcha.db ".backup 'altcha-backup.db'"
```

Copying the file alone is not safe while the service writes. [`epicsoft/dbbackup`](https://hub.docker.com/r/epicsoft/dbbackup) with `BACKUP=sqlite` and `SQLITE_MODE=backup` does the same on a schedule.

## Upgrading

A new version brings its database changes along and applies them on start, each in a transaction. Take a backup before upgrading: going back to an older version after the database was changed does not work — a version that finds a database newer than itself refuses to start and says so in the log, rather than working on data it does not understand.

## What is stored and logged

| | Content | Kept |
|---|---|---|
| Database | the sites; for every spent challenge its random nonce and expiry — no address, no form content | sites until deleted, nonces until the challenge expires |
| Memory | client addresses of the rate limits, counters | addresses for about an hour (the window plus a ten-minute cleanup), counters until the process ends |
| Mail | the submitted form fields, sent to the site's recipient | not stored by the service |
| Log | refused requests with reason and site, refused admin sign-ins with reason (and the user name a proxy passed), changes in the admin UI with the user, mail server errors | as long as the container log is kept |

The service never writes a form field or a visitor's address to the database or to the log. What it sends on is the mail itself — the fields the form has, so a form should only ask for what the recipient needs.

## Mail

`SMTP_HOST` switches `/submit` on. Each submission is one connection, one message:

| `SMTP_SECURITY` | Port | |
|---|---|---|
| `starttls` (default) | 587 | refuses to go on if the server does not offer STARTTLS |
| `tls` | 465 | TLS from the first byte |
| `none` | 25 or any | only for a relay on the same host or network; credentials are refused in this mode |

The certificate is always verified — against `SMTP_TLS_SERVERNAME` when the server is reached by a name that is not in its certificate, for example a container name. Login uses `AUTH PLAIN`, or `AUTH LOGIN` when the server offers only that.

The mail goes from `SMTP_FROM` to the site's recipient. The recipient comes from the site, never from the request, so the service cannot be used to send mail to anyone else. Subject and body are sent base64 encoded; no input of a visitor reaches a mail header except `Reply-To`, and that only after a strict address check.

## Security and limits

- **Proof of work proves that CPU time was spent — not who someone is.** It keeps mass automation out; it does not stop an attacker who is willing to pay for the computing time. The origin check and the rate limits carry the same weight.
- `HMAC_SECRET` signs every challenge. Changing it invalidates all challenges in flight, nothing else. The service derives two separate keys from it (challenge signature and key signature).
- Verification is cheap whatever `ALTCHA_COST` is set to: the service knows the answer when it issues the challenge and signs it, so checking a solution is two HMACs. Issuing a challenge costs one key derivation, which is what `RATE_CHALLENGE_PER_IP` limits.
- CORS only lets a browser read the answer. The protection is the check on the server side, which also applies to requests that do not come from a browser.
- The service sets no cookies and keeps nothing in the browser. It protects forms; it cannot protect a whole page or a login.

## Environment variables

- `HMAC_SECRET` secret for signing the challenges, at least 32 characters ***required***
- `PUBLIC_URL` public address of the service, only used for the snippets in the admin UI (default: *empty*)
- `PORT` public port (default: `8080`)
- `ADMIN_PORT` admin port (default: `8081`)
- `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` Basic auth for the admin port; both or none (default: *empty*)
- `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` bearer token for scripts on the admin port, at least 32 characters (default: *empty*)
- `ADMIN_PROXY_USER_HEADER` header in which a signing-in proxy passes the user name (default: *empty*)
- `ADMIN_TRUSTED_PROXIES` IP addresses and CIDR ranges of the proxies in front of the admin port, comma separated; required with `ADMIN_PROXY_USER_HEADER` (default: *empty*)
- `ADMIN_ALLOWED_USERS` user names the proxy may let in, comma separated; empty lets in everybody the proxy signs in (default: *empty*)
- `DATA_DIR` directory of the database (default: `/data`)
- `TRUST_PROXY` number of reverse proxies in front of the service, `0` to `10` (default: `0`)
- `ALTCHA_ALGORITHM` `PBKDF2/SHA-256`, `PBKDF2/SHA-384`, `PBKDF2/SHA-512`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-384` or `SHA-512` (default: `PBKDF2/SHA-256`). Argon2id and scrypt are not offered: the widget needs separately loaded workers for them
- `ALTCHA_COST` cost of one attempt — PBKDF2 iterations, or hash rounds for `SHA-*` (default: `5000`)
- `ALTCHA_COUNTER_MIN`, `ALTCHA_COUNTER_MAX` range of the number the browser has to find; the work grows with it (default: `5000` and `10000`)
- `ALTCHA_EXPIRES` seconds a challenge stays valid (default: `600`)
- `RATE_CHALLENGE_PER_IP` challenges per client address and hour, `0` for no limit (default: `60`)
- `RATE_SUBMIT_PER_IP` submissions and browser verifications per client address and hour, `0` for no limit (default: `10`). The limit per site is set in the admin UI
- `RATE_VERIFY_PER_IP` verifications without an `Origin` - from a backend - per address and hour; a backend speaks for all its visitors, hence the higher default. `0` for no limit (default: `3600`). All limits count IPv6 per /64
- `MAX_BODY_BYTES` largest accepted request body (default: `32768`)
- `HONEYPOT_FIELD` name of the honeypot field (default: `website`)
- `STATS_RETENTION_DAYS` days the hourly statistics are kept for the admin UI, `1` to `3650` (default: `90`)
- `SMTP_HOST` mail server; empty switches `/submit` off (default: *empty*)
- `SMTP_PORT` (default: `587`, with `SMTP_SECURITY=tls` `465`)
- `SMTP_SECURITY` `starttls`, `tls` or `none` (default: `starttls`)
- `SMTP_TLS_SERVERNAME` name to check the certificate against (default: `SMTP_HOST`)
- `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` login at the mail server; both or none (default: *empty*)
- `SMTP_FROM` sender address, a plain address ***required with SMTP_HOST***
- `SMTP_FROM_NAME` display name of the sender (default: *empty*)
- `SMTP_HELO` name in `EHLO` (default: `altcha`)
- `SMTP_TIMEOUT` seconds per mail server conversation step (default: `20`)
- `TZ` time zone of the log (default: `UTC`)

## Secrets from files

`HMAC_SECRET_FILE`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE`, `ADMIN_API_TOKEN_FILE` and `SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE` read the value from a file instead, for [Docker secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/), Kubernetes secret mounts and comparable mechanisms. A trailing newline is stripped. Setting a variable and its `_FILE` counterpart at the same time is an error, as is a missing or empty file — the service refuses to start and names the variable.

## Metrics

`GET /metrics` on the admin port, Prometheus text format, behind the sign-in. It counts per site and per refusal reason, measures requests and latency per endpoint, the solve time in the browser and the age of a challenge when it is spent (the numbers to tune `ALTCHA_COST` and `ALTCHA_EXPIRES` with), mail delivery, refused admin sign-ins, the database, the process and the event loop.

Every metric with what it answers: [docs/metrics.md](https://gitlab.com/epicsoft-networks/altcha/-/blob/main/docs/metrics.md). Alerting rules to start from: [examples/prometheus-alerts.yml](https://gitlab.com/epicsoft-networks/altcha/-/blob/main/examples/prometheus-alerts.yml).

## Versions

Released through a git tag `X.Y.Z`, which publishes `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `X` and moves `latest`. Changes are listed in the [changelog](https://gitlab.com/epicsoft-networks/altcha/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

| Tag | Content |
|---|---|
| `0.0.1` | exactly this build - **use this in production** |
| `0.0` | latest patch of `0.0` |
| `latest` | newest release of any version - **can change the major version without warning** |
| `develop` | current state of the `develop` branch, not for production |

Before `1.0.0` any release may change the API or a variable, so pin the exact version; the changelog says what changed.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm test                                                  # node --test, no Docker needed
HMAC_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) DATA_DIR=./data npm start
docker build -t altcha:dev .
```

Node.js 24.15 or newer — SQLite comes from the built-in `node:sqlite` module. `.vfox.toml` pins the version used for development.
